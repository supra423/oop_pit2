BUYING/SELLING LOGIC:

Buying:
1. user presses material, inputs which transaction type and quantity (unit of measurement is already given)
// step 1 repeats if user chooses multiple materials, do note that user cannot choose the same material twice
2. For each material that was chosen, fetch materials from the database by materialId to get information about the price.
3. Instantiate one TransactionItem object per chosen material
4. Instantiate ONLY ONE Transaction object
5. For each transactionItem object, calculateSubtotal() to know the subtotal for every transactionItem objects instantiated
6. For each transactionItem object, put them inside the transactionItems ArrayList
7. For each transactionItem object inside the ArrayList, get its subtotal add it to the totalAmount of the Transaction object it belongs to.
8. For each transactionItem object, call updateMaterialStock, para ni sya ma update ang stock sa materials
// now depende nani sa unsa nga type of transaction type gi pili, if nag buy si user, then ang stock sa kato nga particular material
// is mo decrease, then sa pag sell, vice versa nana
9. Insert Transaction to DB (FIRST NI DAPAT IMPORTANTE)
10. Insert TransactionItems to DB
